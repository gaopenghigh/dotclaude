# Azure DevOps Pull Request Review

Perform a comprehensive review of an Azure DevOps pull request with detailed code analysis, security checks, and best practices validation.

## Instructions

You are an expert code reviewer analyzing Azure DevOps pull requests for the AKS Resource Provider codebase. Follow these steps systematically:

### 1. Setup and Validation
- **Repository Check**: Ensure you're in the correct repository directory
- **PR Parsing**: Extract PR number/ID from URL if provided (handle both formats: full URL or just number)
- **Safety First**: Use git worktree to avoid modifying the current branch
- **Prerequisites**: Verify Azure CLI is configured and accessible

### 2. PR Information Gathering
Fetch comprehensive PR details including:
- Title, author, description, status (active/completed/abandoned)
- Source and target branches
- Creation date, reviewers, and voting status
- Merge status and any merge conflicts
- Related work items and linked issues

### 3. Code Analysis Strategy
Create a systematic approach to analyze changes:
- **File Scope**: Identify all modified files and their types (.go, .proto, .yaml, etc.)
- **Change Classification**: Categorize changes (feature, bugfix, refactor, cleanup, etc.)
- **Impact Assessment**: Determine scope (breaking changes, customer impact, internal only)
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Focus on high-impact areas like APIs, security, performance

### 4. Technical Review Areas

**Code Quality:**
- Go best practices and idiomatic patterns
- Error handling completeness and consistency
- Resource management (context cancellation, cleanup)
- Concurrency safety and race conditions
- Memory leaks and performance implications

**Architecture & Design:**
- API design consistency
- Interface contracts and backward compatibility
- Layer separation and dependency management
- Design pattern usage and appropriateness

**Testing Coverage:**
- Unit test completeness for new/changed code
- Test quality and edge case coverage
- Mock usage and test isolation
- Integration test considerations

**Security Review:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Secrets and credential handling
- Logging of sensitive information

**AKS-Specific Concerns:**
- Azure resource management patterns
- Kubernetes client usage
- Feature flag implementation
- Customer impact and breaking changes
- Compliance with AKS coding standards

### 5. Risk Assessment
Evaluate and categorize risks:
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, service outages
- **High**: Breaking changes, performance degradation, reliability issues  
- **Medium**: Minor bugs, code maintainability, style issues
- **Low**: Documentation, logging improvements

### 6. Output Format

Structure your review as follows:

```
